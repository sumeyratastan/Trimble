*Project :*
I use Selenium to automate my browser.
Maven is my build automation tool.
My framework is Java-Selenium-Cucumber which supports the BDD approach.
Also, my framework supports the RestAssured library for API testing. 
When writing API tests, we usually write our scenarios using the Gherkin language in the .feature file. 
Then we write the automation code of the test in the step definitions section. 
The tests are run in the runner class.
That's why I created my framework to show these as well. 
But since this platform is only a test platform, I wrote my tests in the TrimbleTest class.
You can run these tests in this class.

Manual test was performed for all tests before the automation test. I used PostMan for manual testing.
